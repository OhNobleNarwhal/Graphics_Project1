PPM data "converter"


Uploading this for now as I already have my thoughts down on how to do this, just may as well put them into writing

First step is going to be able to open/import a ppm file.

Once i do that, I can read the second character in the file to know if it is a 3 or 6, then write the entirety of that file to a new one whilst changing the identifier.

Ill probably start with converting P3 first since ascii will be easier to manipulate and then once I get that down, I can apply that to the P6 conversion.




//First upload of main was simply playing with a file opener and a print out so I can get used to C. Need to convert that to read in a user inputted p3 or p6, read it and then re write it
